# Dockerized Web Application

This is a Dockerized web application consisting of multiple services: Nginx, Node.js, React, and PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and Docker Compose from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the Dockerized web application on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd your-repository

3. Build and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:
    docker-compose up --build

4. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the web application in your browser at http://localhost:8000.

## Services
Nginx

Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to serve static files and route requests to the appropriate backend services.
Node.js

The Node.js service hosts the backend server for the web application.
React

React is used to build the frontend of the web application.
PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is used as the database for storing application data.
Configuration

You can customize the configuration of each service by modifying the corresponding configuration files in the nginx, server, react, and database directories.
